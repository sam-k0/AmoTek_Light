# AmoTek Light

This is a nieche project allowing you to use BlinkStick products in GMS.

Of course you can also use this like a regular DLL to control the LEDs.
I will most likely use this for my personal purpose but I thought having a C-API thing that doesn't require CMake is cool.

## Dependencies
`hidapi.h, hidapi.dll, hidapi.lib` from 'hidapi'

## Currently WIP!

BlinkStick belongs to UAB Tulogic. I do not claim any ownership of this company, this is an unofficial wrapper based on [https://github.com/ebenoist/libblinkstick]
